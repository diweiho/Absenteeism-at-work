# Analyses of Workplace Absenteeism
 
A simple data analysis looking at absenteeism in a courier company in Brazil from Jul 2007 - Jul 2010.

In this [analysis](https://github.com/diweiho/Absenteeism-at-work/blob/main/analysis.ipynb), I attempt to discover any trends, interesting nuggets of information and factors that influence absenteeism in this particular company. 



## Updates:
(2021-May-24) - V1.0 of the analysis complete! I might come back to this at a later date for more regression and classification analyses when I learn more.


## Misc:
My 1st git repo and 1st data science project performed in Python.
Suggestions and comments welcome!
