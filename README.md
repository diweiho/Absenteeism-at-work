# Absenteeism at work
 
A simple data analysis looking at absenteeism in a courier company in Brazil from Jul 2007 - Jul 2010.

In this analysis, I attempt to discover any trends, interesting nuggets of information and factors that influence absenteeism in this particular company. 

Check out analysis.ipynb in this repo for the analysis and report.
